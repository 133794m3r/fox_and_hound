# Fox and Hound CTF Project

This repo contains the challenges as created by me. They can be easily put on a VM and then hosted in NetLab or a similar environment for studnets. Before COVID19 this whole thing was run on a RPI3 to support 30+ students. Config files will be added in the coming days.

## Background Information
This project contains the fox & hound CTFS the project is just called fox_ctf for 
right now. The CTFs are grouped based upon theme.

## How it works
The ones where the user is rummaging around searching out something are called
 hound<level>
The ones where the user is instead trying do things that are clver are called 
fox<level>

## Progression
The basic progress will be hound<0-n> and then the fox<0-n> with the different fox
species being named for each type of wargame that's being utilized.

## Licenses
