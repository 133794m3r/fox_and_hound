Current version.
The biggest thing is that this _does not_ include any comments that I've included in my
code. So this is actual code that's being written.
Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 2,825
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.60 (7.14)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.44 (5.28)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 1.35
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 80,392

COCOMO II
9.2 Person-months
Schedule is 7.6 Months
Estimated Cost is $525,510

Total cost for the school thusfar ~$377 work-study grant money.
