Current version.
The biggest thing is that this _does not_ include any comments that I've included in my
code. So this is actual code that's being written.
Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 3,299
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 0.7 (8.40)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.47 (5.62)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 1.6
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 94,530


COCOMO II
Effort = 20.1 Person-months
Schedule = 9.9 Months
Cost = $116,706

Total time is ~13-20hrs per week. 1mo=52hrs. Schedule is now at 20.1mo and sitting at 1.5mo of personal-effort.
